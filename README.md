# 2024_Pickem

This project was created to help streamline the process of an NFL Pick'Em challenge hosted by the Clockwork Discord server. 

The Files directory holds all of the picks in csv format as well as the winners of each week depending on matchups chosen by the administrator of the challenge. 

The main script, formatter.py, parses through the corresponding week's data and determines whether or not each player successfully picked the winner, and adds a point to their score.

The Results directory contains all of the winner's picks, and is formatted to be in order from highest number of correct to lowest.
