Cub’s Crawfish. Eat lunch there. It’s an experience.


To make an entire day morning or afternoon at the beach enjoyable,

-Bring sunscreen and apply often.

-Bring, buy, or rent a beach umbrella. It’s a game-changer, allowing your family to enjoy the sights and the roar of the waves without being bombarded by the sun the entire time. Even if sunbathing is your thing, it’s nice to have the option to duck under shade for a bit.

-Bring snacks and drinks (NO GLASS). Casino beach has vendors selling food and drinks, but expect vendor pricing.

-If you go to Casino Beach, there are public restrooms. The earlier you arrive (before 10:00 am), the better; parking gets scarce after lunchtime.

-Dine at weird times to avoid crazy-long wait times. Even then, expect a wait.

-Peg Leg Pete’s and Flounders are some classic restaurants with great food there on the island. 
Crabs is ON the Gulf of Mexico, so the view is nice, especially if you sit at the tables that are in the sand.


Joe Patti Seafood. It’s a larger than life seafood shop where locals buy fresh seafood to take home and cook. For grown ups and kids, it is cool to walk around and see the seafood displayed on ice, being bagged and weighed to order. Plan on spending maybe 30 minutes there. They do have gelato and ready-to-eat foods too, which makes it a nice mid-afternoon destination.
